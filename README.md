# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
  I built a working website where users can get random affirmations or mantras of their own choosing. Within the website also features the ability to enter your own affirmation or mantra in, and have it added to the array of them. After fully cycling through the list, the users creation will pop up as if it has already been added originally. This app is solving the problem of not having something to help motivate you and keep it fresh. By both having the create your own and randomizer, it really does put the power of motivation in the users hands!

### Learning Goals:
The goals of this project were to gain more experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript all in coordination with each other. We wanted to use HTML and CSS specifically to try and match a given goal. It was nice as it was mostly from the ground up so you really got to see how everything had an effect in it. 

### Wins + Challenges:

1. The biggest wins were finally getting full functionality. The code would work but then would break after adding something new. I did find that part challeneging but the reward was such an awesome feeling!
